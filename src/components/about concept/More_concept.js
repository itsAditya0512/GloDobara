                G Lo Dobaara" (popularly known as “GLD”) is a distinct Strategic
                Business Unit (SBU) of Abchi Technologies Private Limited and an
                initiative of social-entrepreneurship. GLD provides quality time
                to elderly people who need a companion. High-achieving children
                now relocate on their own to a new city or perhaps another
                country for a career or married life. Families in metropolitan
                cultures are getting estranged from their own neighbourhoods. In
                addition, the majority of metropolitan households only have one
                child. If their children relocate to a new city, the elderly
                couples feel awkward to cope up in a different culture and
                rather feel comfortable staying at their original residences.
                Their main problem is loneliness and it is taking a toll on
                their mental & physical health. Here, the couples and their
                children are helpless because they don’t know who can take them
                out of this situation. They are not ill, they cannot go to see
                the doctor or psychologist. They are capable of moving freely,
                Aya is not needed for them. The Housemaid can help them with
                daily chores, but cannot be their true companion due to
                differences in IQ, EQ, and family values. Here GLD comes to
                their rescue. It accepts the elderly couple as a capable
                man/woman (not at anyone’s mercy) and makes a friendly
                relationship on equal terms. We make friendships between two
                uneven generations which could be like
                Grandparents-Grandchildren a relationship or just friends.
                <br /> GLD sends enthusiast teenagers/youths of bright
                academics/careers to elderly persons/couples on demand (as slot
                booked through GLD Mobile Apps). Users can choose different
                sorts of services on the web & mobile app.
